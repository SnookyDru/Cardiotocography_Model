# Predicting Fetal Health with Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the "Predicting Fetal Health" repository! This GitHub project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict fetal health using the Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset. Accurate assessment of fetal health is vital in prenatal care, and this project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to enhance this critical aspect of healthcare.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective**: The primary objective is to develop robust predictive models that can classify fetal health based on CTG data with a high degree of accuracy.

- **Dataset**: The project harnesses the comprehensive Cardiotocography dataset, encompassing a wealth of CTG records. These records include essential features such as fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and fetal health status.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: A variety of machine learning algorithms are employed, including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. This diversity allows for a thorough comparison to identify the most effective model for fetal health prediction.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure optimal model training. This preprocessing encompasses addressing missing values, detecting outliers, and performing feature scaling.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is rigorously evaluated using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

## Repository Structure

Here's a breakdown of the repository's organization:

- `CTG`: This contains the Cardiotocography dataset in Excel format.
- `Cardiotocography_ML_Project`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
- `cardiotocography_model`: ML dumped Model which makes predictions by providing the necessary data.
